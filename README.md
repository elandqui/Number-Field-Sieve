# Number-Field-Sieve

This is a basic implementation of the Special Number Field Sieve, programmed to factor the seventh Fermat number, 2^128 + 1. This needs NTL to run.

This program was written for a final project for the course, Integer Factorization, at the University of Illinois in the spring of 2002.
